  - Fetting API data: How to get data from an API and use it in the application. 

  - Listing starreds: Listing the data returned by the GitHub API. 

<h3 align="center"> Developed Application </h3>
In this module, we developed an application to acess the GitHub API by sending an username and adding your basic profile information on the Main page. After that, we can see all the starred repositories of the user touching their profile. If a starred repository is touch the application will redirect to the github page.
