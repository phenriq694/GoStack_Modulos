- Differences of ReactJS: In this class some differences between ReactJS and React Native were presented, such as with HTML that is not used in React Native, being used React Native components, such as 'View' and 'Text', and in the stylization of the components in which we do not have IDs and Class for use CSS Selectors.

- Creating new projects: The application was finish adding a button to add new elements in a list using the React Native component 'FlatList'. 

<h3 align="center"> Developed Application </h3>

In this module, we develop a basic application that makes calls to the API developed in the module [Back-end with Node.js][backend-nodejs-module] and lists all the 'projects' obtained in the response to the request. A button has also been added to add new 'projects'. In this appliaction, it was possible to visualize how the React code can be reused in both projects.
